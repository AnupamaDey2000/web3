                The popularity of meditation is increasing as more people discover its benefits.

              Meditation is a habitual process of training your mind to focus and redirect your thoughts.

              You can use it to increase awareness of yourself and your surroundings. Many people think of it as a way to reduce stress and develop concentration.

               People also use the practice to develop other beneficial habits and feelings, such as a positive mood and outlook, self-discipline, healthy sleep patterns and even increased pain tolerance.

                       <li><h2>Reduces Stress</h2></li>
                         <i id="i">Stress reduction is one of the most common reasons people try meditation.

                            One study including over 3,500 adults showed that it lives up to its reputation for stress reduction (1Trusted Source).
                            
                            Normally, mental and physical stress cause increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol. This produces many of the harmful effects of stress, such as the release of inflammation-promoting chemicals called cytokines.
                            
                            These effects can disrupt sleep, promote depression and anxiety, increase blood pressure and contribute to fatigue and cloudy thinking.
                            
                            In an eight-week study, a meditation style called “mindfulness meditation” reduced the inflammation response caused by stress (2).
                            
                            Another study in nearly 1,300 adults demonstrated that meditation may decrease stress. Notably, this effect was strongest in individuals with the highest levels of stress (3Trusted Source).
                            
                            Research has shown that meditation may also improve symptoms of stress-related conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder and fibromyalgia (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source, 6, 7, 8Trusted Source).</i>

                       <li><h2>Controls Anxiety</h2>
                    </li>
                    <i id="i2">Less stress translates to less anxiety.

                        For example, an eight-week study of mindfulness meditation helped participants reduce their anxiety.
                        
                        It also reduced symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as phobias, social anxiety, paranoid thoughts, obsessive-compulsive behaviors and panic attacks (9).
                        
                        Another study followed up with 18 volunteers three years after they had completed an eight-week meditation program. Most volunteers had continued practicing regular meditation and maintained lower anxiety levels over the long term (10).
                        
                        A larger study in 2,466 participants also showed that a variety of different meditation strategies may reduce anxiety levels (11).
                        
                        For example, yoga has been shown to help people reduce anxiety. This is likely due to benefits from both meditative practice and physical activity (12Trusted Source).
                        
                        Meditation may also help control job-related anxiety in high-pressure work environments. One study found that a meditation program reduced anxiety in a group of nurses (13).

                        <i id="i3">
                            Some forms of meditation can also lead to an improved self-image and more positive outlook on life.

                         Two studies of mindfulness meditation found decreased depression in over 4,600 adults (1Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).

                         One study followed 18 volunteers as they practiced meditation over three years. The study found that participants experienced long-term decreases in depression (10).

                         Inflammatory chemicals called cytokines, which are released in response to stress, can affect mood, leading to depression. A review of several studies suggests meditation may reduce depression by decreasing these inflammatory chemicals (15Trusted Source).

                         Another controlled study compared electrical activity between the brains of people who practiced mindfulness meditation and the brains of others who did not.

                          Those who meditated showed measurable changes in activity in areas related to positive thinking and optimism (16).

                        <i id="i4">
                            Some forms of meditation may help you develop a stronger understanding of yourself, helping you grow into your best self.

                           For example, self-inquiry meditation explicitly aims to help you develop a greater understanding of yourself and how you relate to those around you.

                          Other forms teach you to recognize thoughts that may be harmful or self-defeating. The idea is that as you gain greater awareness of your thought habits, you can steer them toward more constructive patterns (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).

                          A study of 21 women fighting breast cancer found that when they took part in a tai chi program, their self-esteem improved more than it did than in those who received social support sessions (20).

                           In another study, 40 senior men and women who took a mindfulness meditation program experienced reduced feelings of loneliness, compared to a control group that had been placed on a wait list for the program (21).

                          Also, experience in meditation may cultivate more creative problem solving (22Trusted Source).

                        <li><h2> Can Generate Kindness</h2></li>
                        <i id="i5">
                            Some types of meditation may particularly increase positive feelings and actions toward yourself and others.

                           Metta, a type of meditation also known as loving-kindness meditation, begins with developing kind thoughts and feelings toward yourself.

                           Through practice, people learn to extend this kindness and forgiveness externally, first to friends, then acquaintances and ultimately enemies.

                            Twenty-two studies of this form of meditation have demonstrated its ability to increase peoples’ compassion toward themselves and others (30Trusted Source).

                           One study of 100 adults randomly assigned to a program that included loving-kindness meditation found that these benefits were dose-dependent.

                           In other words, the more effort people put into Metta meditation, the more positive feelings they experienced (31).

                           Another group of studies showed the positive feelings people develop through Metta meditation can improve social anxiety, reduce marriage conflict and help anger management (32Trusted Source).

                           These benefits also appear to accumulate over time with the practice of loving-kindness meditation (33Trusted Source).

                      Meditation is something everyone can do to improve their mental and emotional health.

                      You can do it anywhere, without special equipment or memberships.

                        Alternatively, meditation courses and support groups are widely available.

                        There’s a great variety of styles too, each with different strengths and benefits.

                       Trying out a style of mediation suited to your goals is a great way to improve your quality of life, even if you only have a few minutes to do it each day
